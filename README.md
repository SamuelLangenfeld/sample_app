This app is a mini version of Twitter that lets users sign up and create microposts with text and images.  Users can follow or unfollow other users.  It was made following Michael Hartl's [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://www.railstutorial.org).

My app is hosted on [Heroku](https://langenfeld-micropost-app.herokuapp.com/).
